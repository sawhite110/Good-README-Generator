## Description of Project:

* When you create any type of open source project, it's important to create a professional README.md in order for you to explain your project and instruction details. Not only do you need a great README.md for your customer base, you also need one with an explination of how it works, examples for it's use, how to contribute to your project if necessary, and the license that the project falls under.

## Table of Contents

```md
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [License](#license)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Tests](#tests)
* [Questions](#questions)
```

## Installation

* The application will be invoked in your designated command-line by using the following command: 
```md
node index.js
```
```md
* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Usage

* Below is a visual instructional video of how to go through the process of this README Generator.



```md
* This is a comand-line application that will dynamically generate a professional README.md file, from the users input information. This application uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). View the video above to see how the application works and you can also review [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) for further explinations and examples of a professional README.
